### Explanation of the Table Components:

- **Architecture**: The project is structured as a series of Bash scripts, which are straightforward and easy to follow.
- **Code Quality**: The code adheres to good practices with consistent formatting and naming, making it readable.
- **Documentation**: While there is a README, it lacks comprehensive documentation, which could help users understand the project better.
- **Integrations**: The project integrates with a text file for input, showcasing its reliance on external data.
- **Modularity**: Functions are used to encapsulate logic, promoting reusability and clarity.
- **Testing**: There is no automated testing, which could lead to issues if changes are made without verification.
- **Performance**: The scripts perform well with small datasets but may struggle with larger files due to their linear processing nature.
- **Security**: Basic security measures are in place, but there are potential vulnerabilities, especially related to file handling.
- **Dependencies**: The project has minimal dependencies, primarily relying on a text file and a shell environment.
- **Scalability**: The design does not support scaling well, as it is not optimized for concurrent execution or large data processing.
